# Exercise 1 · MCP server

Your hand-written MCP server lives in this folder. Write it in any language you like. The full task is on the exercise page; this file is the short version plus your notes.

## What is already here

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `lectures.json` | The course lectures. Your first tool reads this file. |
| `messages.jsonl` | The messages a client sends, in order, with what your server must answer. |
| `check.mjs` | The self-check. It starts your server, sends those messages and tells you what is wrong. |

## The two tools

1. **`find_lecture`**: everyone writes this one. Input: `number` (1 to 10). It returns the title and topics of that lecture from `lectures.json`. A number outside the range is not a crash and not a protocol error: it is a result with `isError: true` and a readable message.
2. **One of your own**: anything useful that reads local data. Give it a description a model can choose by. Every tool needs one: the self-check applies the same rule to all of them, because a description is the only thing a model reads when it decides what to call.

## Where this goes next

Do not throw this folder away after Exercise 1. From Exercise 3 it becomes **your project's own MCP server**: the same protocol loop, with the tools rewired from `lectures.json` to your real data. Its tools call exactly the same service functions your HTTP routes call, so a tool obeys the same rules an API request does, and it carries a user (the `MCP_TOKEN` in `.env.example`) so it may do what that person may do and no more.

That is the whole design, and it is one sentence: **one set of rules, two front doors.** An MCP tool that writes its own database query is a second way into your data with none of your rules on it, and Exercise 5 is very good at finding those.

Add an `mcp` script to `package.json` (`"mcp": "node mcp-server/server.js"`) so your agent, CI and the lecturer can all start the server the same way.

## Run the self-check

```bash
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- <your start command>
# for example
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- node mcp-server/server.js
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- python3 mcp-server/server.py
# once you have added the mcp script
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- npm run --silent mcp
```

It prints one line per check. Fix the failures yourself: the agent may explain a message or review your handler, but it must not write the protocol code for you.

## How to start it

```bash
npm run --silent mcp
```

## Session transcript

Lines starting with `got:` are the server's log on stderr. Lines starting with `{` are its replies on stdout.

```

## The description experiment

Not run yet. It needs Gemini CLI connected to the server (`gemini`, then `/mcp`), which I cannot start from this environment. To run it: ask "What does lecture 7 cover?", note whether Gemini calls `find_lecture`, change only that tool's description in `server.js`, ask again, and write three sentences here.
